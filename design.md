### Design
Dogelon Index is a collection of cloned Dogelon Mars tokens 
over many blockchains such that their sum is always equal to 
one million billions (1,000,000,000,000,000),
same as [`ELON`](http://dogelon.io).

Stability and convertibility are guaranteed by interventions
by a central authority and by progressively
locked liquidity on popular decentralized exchanges.

To reduce bridges' inherent counterparty risk, Dogelon Index tokens
are brought on new networks by burning the desired amount of tokens
from existing networks and issuing that same amount on the new one
using the standard Dogelon contract;
then a fraction of the tokens are brought
on existing networks and viceversa
using standard bridges, to guarantee users
cospicuous pre-allocated liquidity pools they can use to convert
tokens from exotic networks.

Another positive side-effect of these pools is a significant 
reduction of manual interventions on exchange rates
from the central mint authority (the deployer).

Original Dogelon bridged tokens' tracking is obtained by
means of a central authority, which in this context means:

*if the deployer has opened an Index liquidity pool against token X,
then token X is a legit bridged token*.
